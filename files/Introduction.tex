\chapter{Introduction}
This report will outline the main design concerns as well as the development process of the Racket-O-Meter application.

The project should result in an application that helps athletes with performance tracking and bench marking. Further more it should enable the individual athlete to share personal records and alike on social media.

The application is supposed to receive data from a sensor developed by an external company. This sensor is still under development and the API is still in a state of flux why it is not incorporated in this prototype. Instead the data is faked in a web server available on the internet.

The main user stories covered by the app is as follows.

\section*{Athlete performing}
As an athlete, I want to carry out my regular activities and get a deeper understanding of my movements to enable me to understand me weaknesses and correct my mistakes.

\section*{Share recent performances}
As an athlete, I want to share my recent performance, possibly with locality, with my friends on social media to get feedback and acknowledgment.

\section*{Study performance progress}
As an athlete, I want to study how my training increases my performance over time and how other matters may have impact on this.
Other matters could be other activities like parties, social events or simply the absence of training.

From the stories it is possible to deduct a number of requirements. These are explained next.
