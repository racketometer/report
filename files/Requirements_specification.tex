\chapter{Requirements}
From the user stories a number of functional requirements are established.
A user should be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item share details of a specific performance on Facebook.
	\item see detailed information of a specific performance including performance attributes and meta data on this.
	\item see all performances recorded in the system.
	\item see an overview of the latest performances and some averaged performance attributes.
\end{enumerate}

Further more some non-functional requirements are identified. The user must be able to interact easily and fast with the application with expected gestures.

With this in mind a number of mocks to support the requirements are drafted, figure \ref{fig:mockups}. To the left is the main overview that shows a graph representing the history of performances as well some attributes for the overall performance level of the athlete. By swiping to the left a history list is shown with all recorded performances. By selecting one, a details view is presented with all attributes as well as the recorded meta data.

On all views it is possible to get a menu by clicking the upper left corner where a Profile option is available to let the athlete modify some personal details.
