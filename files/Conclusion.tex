The project set out to create an application that enables athletes to monitor their progress, inspect details of measured attributes for each performance and give the ability to share the details on social media.

The product of the project is an application that gives an overview of the latest five performances. 
A history view where the user can get an overview of all recorded performances and a details view that shows all information regarding a given performance and a button to share the details of the selected performance on Facebook. 
Further more the application has a profile page where the athlete can input personal information and the ability to use gestures for comfortable and recognizable interaction with the graphical user interface.

In the process of implementing the applications functionality, knowledge about how Android enables software development on a mobile platform and how to create a graphical user interface using the Android frameworks. 
Functionality to get data from servers over the internet and persist this on the device demanded understanding of asynchronous processing and the possibilities Android expose on persisting the received data.
